      Desc: "I am currently (spring 2021) studying a three year technology program at Klara s√∂dra upper secondary school (specialisation in Game Development and Design), which will be completed this spring. I started this education because of my interest in games, which at the time mostly consisted of playing them. During this education I feel I have learned much about the basics of Game Development and achieved some proficiency in programming in C# as a whole as well as developing games in Unity. I have also discovered my passion for programming, in particular I enjoy the problem       solving aspect, figuring out what needs to be done and how to fix the issue.",
